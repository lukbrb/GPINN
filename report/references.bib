abstract = {The eikonal equation is utilized across a wide spectrum of science and engineering disciplines. In seismology, it regulates seismic wave traveltimes needed for applications like source localization, imaging, and inversion. Several numerical algorithms have been developed over the years to solve the eikonal equation. However, these methods require considerable modifications to incorporate additional physics, such as anisotropy, and may even breakdown for certain complex forms of the eikonal equation, requiring approximation methods. Moreover, they suffer from computational bottleneck when repeated computations are needed for perturbations in the velocity model and/or the source location, particularly in large 3D models. Here, we propose an algorithm to solve the eikonal equation based on the emerging paradigm of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). By minimizing a loss function formed by imposing the eikonal equation, we train a neural network to output traveltimes that are consistent with the underlying partial differential equation. We observe sufficiently high traveltime accuracy for most applications of interest. We also demonstrate how the proposed algorithm harnesses machine learning techniques like transfer learning and surrogate modeling to speed up traveltime computations for updated velocity models and source locations. Furthermore, we use a locally adaptive activation function and adaptive weighting of the terms in the loss function to improve convergence rate and solution accuracy. We also show the flexibility of the method in incorporating medium anisotropy and free-surface topography compared to conventional methods that require significant algorithmic modifications. These properties of the proposed PINN eikonal solver are highly desirable in obtaining a flexible and efficient forward modeling engine for seismological applications.}

abstract = {Data assimilation for parameter and state estimation in subsurface transport problems remains a significant challenge because of the sparsity of measurements, the heterogeneity of porous media, and the high computational cost of forward numerical models. We present a multiphysics-informed deep neural network machine learning method for estimating space-dependent hydraulic conductivity, hydraulic head, and concentration fields from sparse measurements. In this approach, we employ individual deep neural networks (DNNs) to approximate the unknown parameters (e.g., hydraulic conductivity) and states (e.g., hydraulic head and concentration) of a physical system. Next, we jointly train these DNNs by minimizing the loss function that consists of the governing equations residuals in addition to the error with respect to measurement data. We apply this approach to assimilate conductivity, hydraulic head, and concentration measurements for the joint inversion of these parameter and states in a steady-state advection‚Äìdispersion problem. We study the accuracy of the proposed data assimilation approach with respect to the data size (i.e., the number of measured variables and the number of measurements of each variable), DNN size, and the complexity of the parameter field. We demonstrate that the physics-informed DNNs are significantly more accurate than the standard data-driven DNNs, especially when the training set consists of sparse data. We also show that the accuracy of parameter estimation increases as more different multiphysics variables are inverted jointly.}

	abstract = {Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), introduced in [1], are eÔ¨Äective in solving integerorder partial diÔ¨Äerential equations (PDEs) based on scattered and noisy data. PINNs employ standard feedforward neural networks (NNs) with the PDEs explicitly encoded into the NN using automatic diÔ¨Äerentiation, while the sum of the mean-squared PDE-residuals and the mean-squared error in initial/boundary conditions is minimized with respect to the NN parameters. Here we extend PINNs to fractional PINNs (fPINNs) to solve space-time fractional advection-diÔ¨Äusion equations (fractional ADEs), and we study systematically their convergence, hence explaining both of fPINNs and PINNs for Ô¨Årst time. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, we demonstrate their accuracy and eÔ¨Äectiveness in solving multi-dimensional forward and inverse problems with forcing terms whose values are only known at randomly scattered spatio-temporal coordinates (black-box forcing terms). A novel element of the fPINNs is the hybrid approach that we introduce for constructing the residual in the loss function using both automatic diÔ¨Äerentiation for the integer-order operators and numerical discretization for the fractional operators. This approach bypasses the diÔ¨Éculties stemming from the fact that automatic differentiation is not applicable to fractional operators because the standard chain rule in integer calculus is not valid in fractional calculus. To discretize the fractional operators, we employ the Gr√ºnwald-Letnikov (GL) formula in one-dimensional fractional ADEs and the vector GL formula in conjunction with the directional fractional Laplacian in two- and three-dimensional fractional ADEs. We Ô¨Årst consider the one-dimensional fractional Poisson equation and compare the convergence of the fPINNs against the Ô¨Ånite diÔ¨Äerence method (FDM). We present the solution convergence using both the mean L2 error as well as the standard deviation due to sensitivity to NN parameter initializations. Using diÔ¨Äerent GL formulas we observe Ô¨Årst-, second-, and third-order convergence rates for small size of training sets but the error saturates for larger training sets. We explain these results by analyzing the four sources of numerical errors due to discretization, sampling, NN approximation, and optimization. The total error decays monotonically (below 10‚àí5 for third order GL formula) but it saturates beyond that point due to the optimization error. We also analyze the relative balance between discretization and sampling errors and observe that the sampling size and the number of discretization points (auxiliary points) should be comparable to achieve the highest accuracy. As we increase the depth of the NN up to certain value, the mean error decreases and the standard deviation increases whereas the width has essentially no eÔ¨Äect unless its value is either too small or too large. We next consider time-dependent fractional ADEs and compare white-box (WB) and black-box (BB) forcing. We observe that for the WB forcing, our results are similar to the aforementioned cases, however, for the BB forcing fPINNs outperform FDM. Subsequently, we consider multi-dimensional time-, space-, and space-time-fractional ADEs using the directional fractional Laplacian and we observe relative errors of 10‚àí3 ‚àº 10‚àí4. Finally, we solve several inverse problems in 1D, 2D, and 3D to identify the fractional orders, diÔ¨Äusion coeÔ¨Écients, and transport velocities and obtain accurate results given proper initializations even in the presence of signiÔ¨Åcant noise.},

	abstract = {In this work we investigate the possibility of using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to approximate the Euler equations that model high-speed aerodynamic flows. In particular, we solve both the forward and inverse problems in onedimensional and two-dimensional domains. For the forward problem, we utilize the Euler equations and the initial/boundary conditions to formulate the loss function, and solve the one-dimensional Euler equations with smooth solutions and with solutions that have a contact discontinuity as well as a two-dimensional oblique shock wave problem. We demonstrate that we can capture the solutions with only a few scattered points clustered randomly around the discontinuities. For the inverse problem, motivated by mimicking the Schlieren photography experimental technique used traditionally in high-speed aerodynamics, we use the data on density gradient ‚àáœÅ(x, t), the pressure p(x‚àó, t) at a specified point x = x‚àó as well as the conservation laws to infer all states of interest (density, velocity and pressure fields). We present illustrative benchmark examples for both the problem with smooth solutions and Riemann problems (Sod and Lax problems) with PINNs, demonstrating that all inferred states are in good agreement with the reference solutions. Moreover, we show that the choice of the position of the point x‚àó plays an important role in the learning process. In particular, for the problem with smooth solutions we can randomly choose the position of the point x‚àó from the computational domain, while for the Sod or Lax problem, we have to choose the position of the point x‚àó from the domain between the initial discontinuous point and the shock position of the final time. We also solve the inverse problem by combining the aforementioned data and the Euler equations in characteristic form, showing that the results obtained by using the Euler equations in characteristic form are better than that obtained by using the Euler equations in conservative form. Furthermore, we consider another type of inverse problem, specifically, we employ PINNs to learn the value of the parameter Œ≥ in the equation of state for the parameterized two-dimensional oblique wave problem by using the given data of the density, velocity and the pressure, and we identify the parameter Œ≥ accurately. Taken together, our results demonstrate that in the current form, where the conservation laws are imposed at random points, PINNs are not as accurate as traditional numerical methods for forward problems but they are superior for inverse problems that cannot even be solved with standard techniques.},

We formulate the variational residual of the PDE using the DNN approximation by incorporating the variational form of the problem into the loss function of the network and construct a variational physics-informed neural network (VPINN). By integrating by parts the integrand in the variational form, we lower the order of the differential operators represented by the neural networks, hence eÔ¨Äectively reducing the training cost in VPINNs while increasing their accuracy compared to PINNs that essentially employ delta test functions. For shallow networks with one hidden layer, we analytically obtain explicit forms of the variational residual. We demonstrate the performance of the new formulation for several examples that show clear advantages of VPINNs over PINNs in terms of both accuracy and speed.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces for the Ô¨Årst time, to our knowledge, a framework for physics-informed neural networks in power system applications. Exploiting the underlying physical laws governing power systems, and inspired by recent developments in the Ô¨Åeld of machine learning, this paper proposes a neural network training procedure that can make use of the wide range of mathematical models describing power system behavior, both in steady-state and in dynamics. Physics-informed neural networks require substantially less training data and can result in simpler neural network structures, while achieving high accuracy. This work unlocks a range of opportunities in power systems, being able to determine dynamic states, such as rotor angles and frequency, and uncertain parameters such as inertia and damping at a fraction of the computational time required by conventional methods. This paper focuses on introducing the framework and showcases its potential using a single-machine inÔ¨Ånite bus system as a guiding example. Physics-informed neural networks are shown to accurately determine rotor angle and frequency up to 87 times faster than conventional methods.},

	title = {Characterizing possible failure modes in physics-informed neural networks},
	abstract = {Recent work in scientiÔ¨Åc machine learning has developed so-called physicsinformed neural network (PINN) models. The typical approach is to incorporate physical domain knowledge as soft constraints on an empirical loss function and use existing machine learning methodologies to train the model. We demonstrate that, while existing PINN methodologies can learn good models for relatively trivial problems, they can easily fail to learn relevant physical phenomena for even slightly more complex problems. In particular, we analyze several distinct situations of widespread physical interest, including learning differential equations with convection, reaction, and diffusion operators. We provide evidence that the soft regularization in PINNs, which involves PDE-based differential operators, can introduce a number of subtle problems, including making the problem more ill-conditioned. Importantly, we show that these possible failure modes are not due to the lack of expressivity in the NN architecture, but that the PINN‚Äôs setup makes the loss landscape very hard to optimize. We then describe two promising solutions to address these failure modes. The Ô¨Årst approach is to use curriculum regularization, where the PINN‚Äôs loss term starts from a simple PDE regularization, and becomes progressively more complex as the NN gets trained. The second approach is to pose the problem as a sequence-to-sequence learning task, rather than learning to predict the entire space-time at once. Extensive testing shows that we can achieve up to 1-2 orders of magnitude lower error with these methods as compared to regular PINN training.},

            Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have gained popularity across different engineering fields due to their effectiveness in solving realistic problems with noisy data and often partially missing physics. In PINNs, automatic differentiation is leveraged to evaluate differential operators without discretization errors, and a multitask learning problem is defined in order to simultaneously fit observed data while respecting the underlying governing laws of physics. Here, we present applications of PINNs to various prototype heat transfer problems, targeting in particular realistic conditions not readily tackled with traditional computational methods. To this end, we first consider forced and mixed convection with unknown thermal boundary conditions on the heated surfaces and aim to obtain the temperature and velocity fields everywhere in the domain, including the boundaries, given some sparse temperature measurements. We also consider the prototype Stefan problem for two-phase flow, aiming to infer the moving interface, the velocity and temperature fields everywhere as well as the different conductivities of a solid and a liquid phase, given a few temperature measurements inside the domain. Finally, we present some realistic industrial applications related to power electronics to highlight the practicality of PINNs as well as the effective use of neural networks in solving general heat transfer problems of industrial complexity. Taken together, the results presented herein demonstrate that PINNs not only can solve ill-posed problems, which are beyond the reach of traditional computational methods, but they can also bridge the gap between computational and experimental heat transfer.},

	abstract = {Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) are neural networks (NNs) that encode model equations, like Partial Differential Equations (PDE), as a component of the neural network itself. PINNs are nowadays used to solve PDEs, fractional equations, integral-differential equations, and stochastic PDEs. This novel methodology has arisen as a multi-task learning framework in which a NN must Ô¨Åt observed data while reducing a PDE residual. This article provides a comprehensive review of the literature on PINNs: while the primary goal of the study was to characterize these networks and their related advantages and disadvantages. The review also attempts to incorporate publications on a broader range of collocation-based physics informed neural networks, which stars form the vanilla PINN, as well as many other variants, such as physics-constrained neural networks (PCNN), variational hp-VPINN, and conservative PINN (CPINN). The study indicates that most research has focused on customizing the PINN through different activation functions, gradient optimization techniques, neural network structures, and loss function structures. Despite the wide range of applications for which PINNs have been used, by demonstrating their ability to be more feasible in some contexts than classical numerical techniques like Finite Element Method (FEM), advancements are still possible, most notably theoretical issues that remain unresolved.},

	abstract = {Numerical simulations on fluid dynamics problems primarily rely on spatially or/and temporally discretization of the governing equation using polynomials into a finite-dimensional algebraic system. Due to the multi-scale nature of the physics and sensitivity from meshing a complicated geometry, such process can be computational prohibitive for most real-time applications (e.g., clinical diagnosis and surgery planning) and many-query analyses (e.g., optimization design and uncertainty quantification). Therefore, developing a cost-effective surrogate model is of great practical significance. Deep learning (DL) has shown new promises for surrogate modeling due to its capability of handling strong nonlinearity and high dimensionality. However, the off-the-shelf DL architectures, success of which heavily relies on the large amount of training data and interpolatory nature of the problem, fail to operate when the data becomes sparse. Unfortunately, data is often insufficient in most parametric fluid dynamics problems since each data point in the parameter space requires an expensive numerical simulation based on the first principle, e.g., Navier‚ÄìStokes equations. In this paper, we provide a physics-constrained DL approach for surrogate modeling of fluid flows without relying on any simulation data. Specifically, a structured deep neural network (DNN) architecture is devised to enforce the initial and boundary conditions, and the governing partial differential equations (i.e., Navier‚ÄìStokes equations) are incorporated into the loss of the DNN to drive the training. Numerical experiments are conducted on a number of internal flows relevant to hemodynamics applications, and the forward propagation of uncertainties in fluid properties and domain geometry is studied as well. The results show excellent agreement on the flow field and forward-propagated uncertainties between the DL surrogate approximations and the first-principle numerical simulations.},

	abstract = {The eikonal equation is utilized across a wide spectrum of science and engineering disciplines. In seismology, it regulates seismic wave traveltimes needed for applications like source localization, imaging, and inversion. Several numerical algorithms have been developed over the years to solve the eikonal equation. However, these methods require considerable modifications to incorporate additional physics, such as anisotropy, and may even breakdown for certain complex forms of the eikonal equation, requiring approximation methods. Moreover, they suffer from computational bottleneck when repeated computations are needed for perturbations in the velocity model and/or the source location, particularly in large 3D models. Here, we propose an algorithm to solve the eikonal equation based on the emerging paradigm of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). By minimizing a loss function formed by imposing the eikonal equation, we train a neural network to output traveltimes that are consistent with the underlying partial differential equation. We observe sufficiently high traveltime accuracy for most applications of interest. We also demonstrate how the proposed algorithm harnesses machine learning techniques like transfer learning and surrogate modeling to speed up traveltime computations for updated ve¬≠ locity models and source locations. Furthermore, we use a locally adaptive activation function and adaptive weighting of the terms in the loss function to improve convergence rate and solution accuracy. We also show the flexibility of the method in incorporating medium anisotropy and free-surface topography compared to con¬≠ ventional methods that require significant algorithmic modifications. These properties of the proposed PINN eikonal solver are highly desirable in obtaining a flexible and efficient forward modeling engine for seismological applications.},

	abstract = {In this work, we present a new physics informed neural network (PINN) algorithm for solving brittle fracture problems. While most of the PINN algorithms available in the literature minimize the residual of the governing partial differential equation, the proposed approach takes a different path by minimizing the variational energy of the system. Additionally, we modify the neural network output such that the boundary conditions associated with the problem are exactly satisfied. Compared to the conventional residual based PINN, the proposed approach has two major advantages. First, the imposition of boundary conditions is relatively simpler and more robust. Second, the order of derivatives present in the functional form of the variational energy is of lower order than in the residual form used in conventional PINN and hence, training the network is faster. To compute the total variational energy of the system, an efficient scheme that takes as input a geometry described by spline based CAD model and employs Gauss quadrature rules for numerical integration, has been proposed. Moreover, we note that for obtaining the crack path, the proposed PINN has to be trained at each load/displacement step, which can potentially make the algorithm computationally inefficient. To address this issue, we propose to use the concept ‚Äòtransfer learning‚Äô wherein, instead of re-training the complete network, we only re-train the network partially while keeping the weights and the biases corresponding to the other portions fixed. With this setup, the computational efficiency of the proposed approach is significantly enhanced. The proposed approach is used to solve six fracture mechanics problems. For all the examples, results obtained using the proposed approach match closely with the results available in the literature. For the first two examples, we compare the results obtained using the proposed approach with the conventional residual based neural network results. For both the problems, the proposed approach is found to yield better accuracy compared to conventional residual based PINN algorithms.},

The particular numerical method used for integration depends on the application. Unfortunately, when physics is not fully understood, the discrepancies between predictions and observed responses can be large and unacceptable. In this paper, we propose an approach that uses observed data to estimate the missing physics in the original model (i.e., model-form uncertainty). In our approach, we Ô¨Årst design recurrent neural networks to perform numerical integration of the ordinary differential equations. Then, we implement the recurrent neural network as a directed graph. This way, the nodes in the graph represent the physics-informed kernels found in the ordinary differential equations. We quantify the missing physics by carefully introducing data-driven in the directed graph. This allows us to estimate the missing physics (discrepancy term) even for hidden nodes of the graph. We studied the performance of our proposed approach with the aid of three case studies (fatigue crack growth, corrosion-fatigue crack growth, and bearing fatigue) and stateof-the-art machine learning software packages. Our results demonstrate the ability to perform estimation of discrepancy, reducing gap between predictions and observations, at reasonable computational cost.},

With all that, the main advantage of our approach is that one can implement hybrid models combining physics-informed and data-driven kernels, where data-driven kernels are used to reduce the gap between predictions and observations. Alternatively, we can also perform model parameter identification. In order to illustrate our approach, we used two case studies. The first one consisted of performing fatigue crack growth integration through Euler‚Äôs forward method using a hybrid model combining a data-driven stress intensity range model with a physics-based crack length increment model.

We Ô¨Ånd evidence for cosmologically coupled mass growth among these black holes, with zero cosmological coupling excluded at 99.98\% conÔ¨Ådence. The redshift dependence of the mass growth implies that, at z ÔÇà 7, black holes contribute an effectively constant cosmological energy density to Friedmann‚Äôs equations. The continuity equation then requires that black holes contribute cosmologically as vacuum energy. We further show that black hole production from the cosmic star formation history gives the value of Œ©Œõ measured by Planck while being consistent with constraints from massive compact halo objects. We thus propose that stellar remnant black holes are the astrophysical origin of dark energy, explaining the onset of accelerating expansion at z ‚àº 0.7.},

Here we developed P-NET‚Äîa biologically informed deep learning model‚Äîto stratify patients with¬†prostate cancer by treatment-resistance state and evaluate molecular drivers of treatment resistance for therapeutic targeting through complete model interpretability. We demonstrate that P-NET can predict cancer state using molecular data with a performance that is superior to other modelling approaches. Moreover, the biological interpretability within P-NET revealed established and novel molecularly altered candidates, such as

              and
              FGFR1
              , which were implicated in predicting advanced disease and validated in vitro. Broadly, biologically informed fully interpretable neural networks enable preclinical discovery and clinical prediction in prostate cancer and may have general applicability across cancer types.},

	abstract = {We present a physics-informed deep neural network (DNN) method for estimating hydraulic conductivity in saturated and unsaturated flows governed by Darcy's law. For saturated flow, we approximate hydraulic conductivity and head with two DNNs and use Darcy's law in addition to measurements of hydraulic conductivity and head to train these DNNs. For unsaturated flow, we approximate unsaturated conductivity function and capillary pressure with DNNs and train these DNNs using measurements of capillary pressure and the Richards equation. Because it is difficult to measure unsaturated conductivity in the field, we assume that no measurements of unsaturated conductivity are available. The proposed approach enforces the partial differential equation (PDE) (Darcy or Richards equation) constraints by minimizing the PDE residual at select points in the simulation domain. We demonstrate that physics constraints increase the accuracy of DNN approximations of sparsely observed functions and allow for training DNNs when no direct measurements of the functions of interest are available. For the saturated conductivity estimation problem, we show that the physics-informed DNN method is more accurate than the state-of-the-art maximum a posteriori probability method. For the unsaturated flow in homogeneous porous media, we find that the proposed method can accurately estimate the pressure-conductivity relationship based on the capillary pressure measurements only, even in the presence of measurement noise.},

	abstract = {Solving Ô¨Çuid dynamics problems mainly rely on experimental methods and numerical simulation. However, in experimental methods it is difÔ¨Åcult to simulate the physical problems in reality, and there is also a high-cost to the economy while numerical simulation methods are sensitive about meshing a complicated structure. It is also time-consuming due to the billion degrees of freedom in relevant spatial-temporal Ô¨Çow Ô¨Åelds. Therefore, constructing a cost-effective model to settle Ô¨Çuid dynamics problems is of signiÔ¨Åcant meaning. Deep learning (DL) has great abilities to handle strong nonlinearity and high dimensionality that attracts much attention for solving Ô¨Çuid problems. Unfortunately, the proposed surrogate models in DL are almost black-box models and lack interpretation. In this paper, the Physical Informed Neural Network (PINN) combined with Resnet blocks is proposed to solve Ô¨Çuid Ô¨Çows depending on the partial differential equations (i.e., NavierStokes equation) which are embedded into the loss function of the deep neural network to drive the model. In addition, the initial conditions and boundary conditions are also considered in the loss function. To validate the performance of the PINN with Resnet blocks, Burger‚Äôs equation with a discontinuous solution and Navier-Stokes (N-S) equation with continuous solution are selected. The results show that the PINN with Resnet blocks (Res-PINN) has stronger predictive ability than traditional deep learning methods. In addition, the Res-PINN can predict the whole velocity Ô¨Åelds and pressure Ô¨Åelds in spatial-temporal Ô¨Çuid Ô¨Çows, the magnitude of the mean square error of the Ô¨Çuid Ô¨Çow reaches to 10‚àí5. The inverse problems of the Ô¨Çuid Ô¨Çows are also well conducted. The errors of the inverse parameters are 0.98\% and 3.1\% in clean data and 0.99\% and 3.1\% in noisy data.},
